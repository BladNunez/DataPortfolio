        <h1>Project Overview</h1>
        <p>
          In this project I webscrape 10 seasons worth of game data for the
          Boston Celtics. I use the data to be able to create a linear
          regression model using the historical game data to be able to predict
          points in a game for the team using predictive variables such as
          (field goals, field goal %, 3 pointers, 3 point percentage, free
          throw, free throw %, assists, opponent points) and my target variable
          of points(Tm).

          Here I use a jointplot that consists of both a scatter plot to compare
          two variables to show correlation and as well as a histogram to show
          distrubution of each variable. The histogram on the top of the graph
          represents the distrubution of 3 point attempts while the histogram on
          the right represents distrubution of points in a game. In our scatter
          plot we see there is a little correlation between 3 point attempts and
          points in games over our 10 seasons.

        <figcaption>
          Again we use a joint plot to show both correlation and distrubution of
          field goals and points in a game variables. We see that there is a
          positive correlation between these two variables such as the more
          field goals there are the more points will be scored in a game.

        <figcaption>
          After splitting my data into testing and training sets we use another
          scatter plot to compare the prediction models values and the actual
          values from our dataset. We see that our predictive values are very
          accurate to the actual values of our dataset. For example to show the
          performance of the model:
          <br />
          Mean Absolute Error: 1.344
          <br />
          Mean Squared Error: 3.492
          <br />
          R-Squared Score (R2): 1

        <p>
          I used 10 seasons worth of Boston Celtics game data from the
          basketball reference website.

        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <p>
          This was my first project creating a model. My challenges here were
          learning more about linear regression models and what factors are used
          to be able to monitor if the model is accurate or not such as mean
          absolute error and mean square error. Another challenge was taking
          some time to understand the syntax of using the SkLearn library to
          create and fit my model to then predict my target value.
