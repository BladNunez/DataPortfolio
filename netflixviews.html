      <h1>Netflix Views Analysis</h1>

        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>
          In this project, I analyzed Netflix viewing data from Jan - June 2023.
          This project analyzes what genres and shows were popular this year
          (2023) and compares the correlation between the hours of viewing vs
          the amount of ratings for each show. I used multiple technologies to
          answer questions risen from this dataset.

      <section id="data-sources">
        <h2>Data Sources</h2>
        <p>
          I obtained this data from
          <a
            href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vassyesboy/netflix-engagement-jan-jun-23"
            target="_blank"
            >Kaggle</a
          >, a website that contains datasets for analyzing, and this dataset
          was called Netflix engagement Jan-June '23.

      <section id="technologies-used">
        <h2>Technologies Used</h2>
        <p>
          The tech stack I used for this project was Excel, SQL, and the BI tool
          Tableau.
        </p>

      <section id="project-structure">
        <h2>Project Structure</h2>
        <p>
          The project structure of this project is simple. The CSV file I used
          is in the directory as well as my dumped SQL file containing all
          queries that analyzed the dataset.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="datacleaning">
        <h2>Data Cleaning and Preprocessing</h2>
        <p>
          I imported the CSV file into excel to begin cleaning the dataset. I
          started with removing all duplicate values to then standarizing my
          dataset so all columns are upper case if they are text and the date
          columns would all be the same format. I dropped all missing values in
          my dataset so it would not negatively alter my data as I was creating
          my visualizations.

      <section id="challenges">
        <h2>Challenges Faced</h2>
        <p>
          This was my first introduction into Tableau and it was the only
          challenge I had. I learned how to navigate the application and what to
          filter and modify such as columns when I add them to a row and column.
          After this I got my feet wet with the software and now comfortable to
          move onto other projects using Tableau.

      <section id="conclusions">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          This project was my first time using a BI tool to analyze data and
          find trends and statistics about this specific dataset. This project
          was signifcant due to it being the first full data analysis project I
          completed where I got to access and import data, clean the data for
          analysis, find metrics about the data and lastly use those metrics to
          answer questions through visualizations.
