        <h1>Project Overview</h1>
        <p>
          In this project I analyze bikeshare trips in the city of Austin,TX
          from 2013 - 2024. In the year 2024 our data is only updated up until
          February. Our project contains information about bikeshare trips in
          the city such as the duration of the trip in minutes, the starting and
          ending stations a bike was used from and placed back in, the location
          of those bikes and the date and time when the bikes were used. Our
          project goals are listed down below:

          <br /><br />
          1.) Analyze bike trip durations to understand average trip lengths and
          peak usage times.
          <br />
          2.) Identify popular start and end stations to optimize bike
          distribution and station maintenance.
          <br />
          3.) Explore subscriber types to understand user demographics and
          preferences.
          <br />
          4.) Visualize bike usage trends over time to identify seasonal
          variations.

        <figcaption>
          Here I use a histogram to show the distribution of time per ride in
          Austin, TX from 2013 - 2024. In our data we have that riders ranged
          from 2 - 1000+ minutes on their rides over this time frame. For the
          riders with a 1000+ minutes that could mean that they used the bikes
          over certain amount of days but we need more data to confirm that
          theory but also are probable outliers in our data. As we see in our
          histogram the majority of our riders throughout the years typically
          ride for around 10 - 100 minutes. On the x-axis our time duration is
          written in exponents due to the many values of our time duration data.
          For example 10^1 is 10 minutes and 10^2 is 100 minutes and so on.

          A bar chart is used to compare the top 10 most popular starting
          stations in the city of Austin. As we see here throughout the time
          frame of our data these 10 stations have gotten over 20000 riders.
          These starting locations would need to be updated and maintained due
          to the heavy usage it gets.
        </figcaption>

        <img src="images/bike/3.png" alt="one" width="650" height="500" />
        <figcaption>
          Another bar chart is used for the ending stations and it seems that
          users return their bikes to the same location they started from so
          again to reiterate we need to maintain and keep up to date these 10
          stations due to the heavy usage it receives.

        <figcaption>
          Here we have a table of our diffrent subscriptions that we offer and
          the average minutes each subscription rides for. We can see that our
          single trip ride subscription is the most popular according to the
          amount of time the bikes are in use for. The ride scout single ride
          has the lowest amount of ride duration with 2 minutes.

          Subplot is used here to showcase time series of our bikeshare usage
          from 2013 - 2024 as well as the usage of the bikeshare in the months
          of 2023. In our line chart we see the trend of usage throughout the
          years and we can see that 2018 was the most popular year with almost
          400,000 riders. From 2019-2020 bike usage declined sharply. Since then
          it has risen from 2021-2023. We only have data for the month of
          January for 2024 so we would need updated data up to this point to see
          the usage over time for this year. Our second graph contains data from
          2023 and the usage over the months for our bikeshare. We see that the
          month of October was the most popular month with over 35000 riders.
          August - November was the most popular months in the year of 2023 with
          December having the lowest volume of riders.

        <figcaption>
          For the year of 2023 I wanted to see what our peak hours would be and
          we found that 5Pm was the most popular time to ride with over 20000
          riders throughout the year. 1Pm - 6Pm was the most busy hours with
          20000+ riders in the year and the lowest volume of riders was at 4Am.
          Our x-axis begins from 0 - 23 and for time this translates to Midnight
          - 11Pm.

            I recommend to drop the ride scout single ride subscription due to
            not having much usage and utilize specials for more bike use

        <p>
          I used the Austin bikeshare dataset from Google BigQuery. I was able
          to connect to Google BigQuery using a client object from the
          google.cloud library and running a query in python to be able to load
          the dataset into a pandas dataframe to begin analysis.

        <p>
          One challenge I ran into was cleaning out the data that was in my
          station name columns. In the start column there was stations that were
          the same name but either in diffrent order or in one word in some
          cases. I manually went into the data and fixed each one by one so my
          data was consistent and my analysis accurate.
