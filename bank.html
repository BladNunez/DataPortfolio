        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>
          In this project I extracted my personal debit card transactions in my
          banking app from 2024. This project aims to explore those transactions
          and utilize SQL to gain insights on spending trends and
          patterns,category-wise spending and high value purchases.

        <p>
          I created a MYSQL database that contains one table called
          'Transactions'. Within my table I have columns
          'Transaction_Date','Posted_Date','Card_NO','Description','Category','Debit'.
          I did not have to go through a data cleaning process due to the data
          being cleaned already after my data was exported from my banking
          application. Below is my table diagram:

        <h1>Analysis</h1>
        <h3>How much am I spending each month?</h3>
        <img
          src="images/bank/1.jpg"
          alt="UML Diagram"
          width="500"
          height="350"
        />
        <p>
          I wanted to see how much I spent each month in 2024. I sorted by month
          starting from January (1) to December (12). I saw a lot of fluctation
          of the amount of money spent each month. In the year August was my
          lowest amount at $196.73 spent while October was the highest amount
          spent that year at $949.89.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>What are my peak spending days of the week?</h3>
        <img
          src="images/bank/2.jpg"
          alt="UML Diagram"
          width="500"
          height="350"
        />
        <p>
          I wanted to analyze what specific days did I spend the most. Were some
          days more then others? Indeed it was I found that on Tuesday I spent
          the most amount of money in the year at $1187.57. I was suprised by
          this thinking that the most would be a Friday or Saturday due to it
          being the weekend and going out with friends or family would make you
          spend. Saturday was the second most day that I spent most money in the
          year.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>Do I spend more on weekdays or weekends?</h3>
        <img
          src="images/bank/3.jpg"
          alt="UML Diagram"
          width="550"
          height="350"
        />
        <p>
          During the week I go to the gym and to work so commuting and buying
          lunch would be an example of expenses during the week. I found that
          most of my money that I spent in 2024 was during the week Monday -
          Friday. Now a goal for me would be to decrease that spending
          throughout the week.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>What are my top spending categories</h3>
        <img
          src="images/bank/4.jpg"
          alt="UML Diagram"
          width="500"
          height="350"
        />
        <p>
          I looked at the type of categories that I spent the most money on and
          I used SQL to show me the top 5 categories most of my money went to.
          It looks like repaying my credit cards was the most money technically
          spent on repaying something back. It looks like I spent $4689.95 on
          dining such as going out to eat and ordering takeout. Technically
          dining would be the number one category due to myself using my credit
          cards to buy food as well.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>What percentage of my total spending goes to each category?</h3>
        <img
          src="images/bank/5.jpg"
          alt="UML Diagram"
          width="500"
          height="400"
        />
        <p>
          To look more into the data I wanted to see the percentages for each
          category such as the amount of times I payed for a specific thing.
          Dining was the number one category where I spent the most amount of
          times at 38%. 14% of the time was paying my credit card bills. So far
          in my analysis dining has been the number one category where most of
          my money went in 2024.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>How does my spending by category change over time?</h3>
        <img
          src="images/bank/6.jpg"
          alt="UML Diagram"
          width="500"
          height="400"
        />
        <p>
          Because I spent a lot of money on dining I wanted to see the trend
          over the year on how my spending has been month to month on going out
          to eat. I found that September through November were the months that I
          consistently spent a lot of money eating out while July was also a
          high spending month on dining out at $302.09.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>What are my biggest transactions?</h3>
        <img
          src="images/bank/7.jpg"
          alt="UML Diagram"
          width="700"
          height="450"
        />
        <p>
          I wanted to visual if I had any impulse buys for big purchases
          throughout the year. For me I chose any payments that were greater
          then 300. I found that most of my big payments were to my credit card
          bills and a trip I planned towards the end of the year. Those big
          purchases were my flight ticket and lodging. I was pleased to see that
          I did not have any big impulse buys throughout the year.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          After analyzing my transactions in 2024 I realized I spent a lot on
          dining. One of my goals now in 2025 is to save more money so I plan to
          lower eating out and cooking meals at home. Also from this analysis I
          see that no other category stuck out to me for overspending but I will
          still need to be aware of how I spend in those other categories. Most
          of the money I spent was during the week Monday-Friday. Another goal
          for myself is to see where I can lower those expenses such as bringing
          homemade lunch to work or not driving so much to then spend on gas.
          After this analysis I am curious to see how the next year will be on
          my financial road.
