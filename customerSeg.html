        <h1>Project Overview</h1>
        <p>
          I wanted to see how a retail store can perform better to keep
          customers and to expand their domain in the sales world by reaching
          new customers as well as keeping costs low. The dataset I used was
          from a fake retail store based in the United Kingdom but shipped
          worldwide. It contains what the product they sold was and to what
          customer based in a country as well as quantity and price of the
          product the customer bought and the date they bought it on. I found
          insights and gave recommendations for this retail company down below.

          removed those and a null date for data consistency

        <h2>Feature Engineering</h2>
        <p>
          To show that orders were cancelled or fufilled I created an
          'orderStatus' column that contained a text to show if the order was
          fufilled or cancelled. I knew if they were cancelled if the invoice
          number column was a zero and the quantity was a negative number. I
          split the initial 'invoiceDate' column into two columns:
          'PurchaseDate' , 'PurchaseHour'. This showed the date of when the
          order was fufilled and the hour. This was for better readability.

          orderStatus = "Cancelled" and month(PurchaseDate) in (10,11,12) group

          I would need more data for a more accurate analysis. The data
          initially started off very messy on the date column so I had to get
          rid of much it due to that. If the data came clean then I would have
          more information. More information on cancelled orders would have been
          great for this analysis. I came up with the idea that in the dataset
          cancelled orders had no invoice number and a negative quantity. If we
          had more information on why the order was cancelled then I would have
          a better idea on how to analyze what we can do to retain orders.
