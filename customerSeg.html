        <h1>Project Overview</h1>
        <p>
          I wanted to see how a retail store can perform better to keep
          customers and to expand their domain in the sales world by reaching
          new customers as well as keeping costs low. The dataset I used was
          from a fake retail store based in the United Kingdom but shipped
          worldwide in the years of 2010 - 2012. It contains what product they
          sold and where the customer is located country wise as well as
          quantity and price of the product the customer bought and the date
          they bought it on. I found insights and gave recommendations for this
          retail company down below.

        <p>
          <b
            >1. What is the total revenue generated by the online retail store
            during the dataset period?

        <figcaption>
          I start off this analysis with a line chart that is used to show the
          progression of a variable over time. Here we look at the revenue of
          our online store over our three years. In 2010 it received around
          $70,000 dollars. In 2011 it did better at around $98,000 dollars and
          in 2012 the company revenue doubled at over $200,000 dollars.

          <b
            >2. What is the average order value (AOV) for the online retail
            store?</b

        </p>
        <img src="images/retail/two.jpg" alt="one" width="400" height="400" />
        <figcaption>
          Average order value is where a company tracks the average dollar
          amount spent each time a customer places an order on a website or
          mobile app. For this retail company the AOV is $3.92 across the three
          years.

        <figcaption>
          A bar chart is used to compare number objects and here we compare how
          many customers are in each country where our customers reside. Of
          course the UK has the most customers due to this company being UK
          based. The lowest amount of customers we have is 1 and they live in
          Hong Kong.
        </figcaption>

        <figcaption>
          A Bar chart is used again and we compare the top 5 best selling
          products. Over $160,000 dollars worth of the product "paper craft,
          little birdie" was sold. This would mean that this product is the most
          valuable out of all the retail store sells.

        <figcaption>
          Here we use a bar chart to see the trend of a variable over time. We
          compare each year from 2010-2012 monthly purchase frequency. Purchase
          frequency is the number of times that your customers make a purchase
          from you within a specified period of time. In 2010 the first month
          made no sales and from month 2-6 it was at a steady rate of a little
          over 0.05 purchase frequency with then a spike of frequent buying from
          months 6-9 with then a decline towards the ending months. 2011 started
          off with progressivley rising purchase frequency and its peak was
          around 0.13. 2012 looked the same as the previous year but with a huge
          rise in purchase frequency towards the end of the year with its peak
          purchase frequency over 0.25.

        <h2>Insights/Recommendations</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            From the many items sold we should get rid of all products that did
            not sell at least 100 items. From analysis this would bring the
            initial number of 3556 items in our store down to 537. We can
            maintain the store efficiently as well as lower costs on storage and
            buying new products.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            We should focus more marketing in western/eastern Europe. Most of
            our customers are from there so we should build a higher base of
            customers there and after market in other regions of the world.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Prioritize the top 10 products that sold by most quantity and also
            prioritize the top 5 products sold by unit price. By doing this it
            guarantees products selling meaning revenue.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            With the last three months in 2012 having a high purchase frequency
            I would recommend to sell the same products from those months the
            next year.

        <h2>Feature Engineering</h2>
        <p>
          To show that orders were cancelled or fufilled I created an
          'orderStatus' column that contained a text to show if the order was
          fufilled or cancelled. I knew if they were cancelled if the invoice
          number column was a zero and the quantity was a negative number. I
          split the initial 'invoiceDate' column into two columns:
          'PurchaseDate' , 'PurchaseHour'. This showed the date of when the
          order was fufilled and the hour. This was for better readability.

          I would need more data for a more accurate analysis. The data
          initially started off very messy on the date column so I had to get
          rid of much it due to that. If the data came clean then I would have
          more information. More information on cancelled orders would have been
          great for this analysis. I came up with the idea that in the dataset
          cancelled orders had no invoice number and a negative quantity. If we
          had more information on why the order was cancelled then I would have
          a better idea on how to analyze what we can do to retain orders and
          fufill them.
