        <h1>Project Overview</h1>
        <p>
          In this project I analyze data from a stack overflow survey that was
          conducted in May of 2023 from May 8th - May 19th to find out
          information on software developers such as salary, how they like to
          learn how to code and favorite technolgies used. Questions I will be
          answering in this analysis are:
          <br />
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>In what Industries do developers get paid the most?</li>
          <li>How much does remote working matter to employees?</li>
          <li>How does coding experience affect the level of pay?</li>
          <li>What is the most popular method of learning to code?</li>
          <li>
            Are you more likely to get a developer role with a masters degree?
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Insights</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Developers get paid the most in the financial industry with an
            average salary of $95,000
          </li>
          <li>
            31000 people work in hybrid setting and 30000 people are fully
            remote. Only 12,000 people are fully in person. this shows that
            developers prefer working remote or having a hybrid schedule.
          </li>
          <li>
            There is a positive correlation with with compensation as you have
            more work experience and the highest paid developer in this dataset
            was at $300,000 with 40 years of experience.
          </li>
          <li>
            The most popular method of learning how to code is through books.
            44,000 people agreed with this method.
          </li>
          <li>
            Most developers in our survey had bachelors degrees then masters.
            From analysis you do not need a masters to get a developer role.
