        <h1>Project Overview</h1>
        <p>
          In this project I analyze data from a stack overflow survey that was
          conducted in May of 2023 from May 8th - May 19th to find out
          information on software developers such as salary, how they like to
          learn how to code and favorite technolgies used. Questions I will be
          answering in this analysis are:
          <br />
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>In what Industries do developers get paid the most?</li>
          <li>How much does remote working matter to employees?</li>
          <li>How does coding experience affect the level of pay?</li>
          <li>What is the most popular method of learning to code?</li>
          <li>
            Are you more likely to get a developer role with a masters degree?
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h1>Data Analysis (Data Visualization)</h1>
        <p><b>1. In what Industries do developers get paid the most? </b></p>
        <img src="images/stack/one.png" alt="one" width="750" height="500" />
        <figcaption>
          Here I use a bar chart that compares the diffrent industries our
          developers work in. The Y-axis shows the salaries that were reported
          in our survey and we see here that developers working in the financial
          industry make the most compared to other industries at $95,000.
        </figcaption>
        <br /><br />

        <p>
          <b>2. How much does remote working matter to employees? </b>
        </p>
        <img src="images/stack/two.png" alt="one" width="450" height="450" />
        <figcaption>
          This table here shows the diffrent work settings that were reported in
          our survey alongside the amount of developers in each work setting. As
          we can see most developers work either remote or hybrid with a very
          low number of fully in person work. This shows that developers want to
          work either fully remote or hybrid.
        </figcaption>
        <br /><br />

        <p>
          <b>3. How does coding experience affect the level of pay? </b>
        </p>
        <img src="images/stack/three.png" alt="one" width="650" height="500" />
        <figcaption>
          Here a scatter plot is used to compare the professional years worked
          of developers and the compensation that comes with that experience.
          From our data we see that most developers that have 10+ years make
          around $100,000 and the more experience they get there seems to not be
          a change in compensation. As we can see there is one outlier of
          someone with 40 years of experience making well north of $300,000.
        </figcaption>
        <br /><br />
        <p>
          <b> 4. What is the most popular method of learning to code? </b>
        </p>
        <img src="images/stack/four.png" alt="one" width="500" height="500" />
        <figcaption>
          We use another table to display all the ways our developers like to
          learn how to code alongside the amount of developers in each category.
          A large majority of developers from the survey like to learn from
          books while the second most popular way to learn how to code is
          through online courses or certifications.
        </figcaption>
        <br /><br />
        <p>
          <b>
            5. Are you more likely to get a developer role with a masters
            degree?
          </b>
        </p>
        <img src="images/stack/five.png" alt="one" width="500" height="500" />
        <figcaption>
          A majority of our developers have a bachelors degree which is more
          then those who have a masters. From our data we see that people do not
          need a masters degree to get a role as a developer and a bachelors is
          enough but also is possible to not have a college degree and still
          land a role like the 1555 people with primary/elementry school
          education and 1448 people having something else.

        <ul>
          <li>
            Developers get paid the most in the financial industry with an
            average salary of $95,000
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            31000 people work in hybrid setting and 30000 people are fully
            remote. Only 12,000 people are fully in person. this shows that
            developers prefer working remote or having a hybrid schedule.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            There is a positive correlation with with compensation as you have
            more work experience and the highest paid developer in this dataset
            was at $300,000 with 40 years of experience.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            The most popular method of learning how to code is through books.
            44,000 people agreed with this method.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Most developers in our survey had bachelors degrees then masters.
            From analysis you do not need a masters to get a developer role.

        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <p>
          A challenge I had with this project was working on comparing years of
          experience with compensation using a scatter plot. I grouped the years
          of experience to have a smaller amount of points graphed. Initially
          the more years of experience you have the higher compensation but what
          I received from the scatter plot was that the more years worked the
          salary did not change. For future consideration I will go back into
          the data and analyze the salaries more as well as grouping it in a
          diffrent way if possible for visual purposes.
