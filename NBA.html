        </h1>
        <p>
          Basketball debates often hinge on subjective opinions, especially when
          it comes to the GOAT conversation. This project brings data to the
          forefront. Using MySQL, I analyzed over 12,000 player-season records
          spanning 27 NBA seasons (1996 - 2022) to uncover performance trends,
          compare eras, and identify statistically driven MVPs. Here is a link
          below to my SQL file that contains my code and comments.

        <ol>
          <li>
            Identify season leaders in scoring, rebounding, and playmaking and
            evaluate their efficiency
          </li>
          <li>
            Compare player size, style, and performance across four eras: 1990s,
            2000s, 2010s, and 2020s.
          </li>
          <li>
            Determine which teams, positions, or player profiles consistently
            produce top performers.
          </li>
          <li>
            Use a weighted performance index to crown MVPs and compare them to
            official NBA selections.

          >&nbsp;Methodology
        </h1>
        <h3>Data Loading</h3>
        <p>
          The dataset contains 12,844 rows of data that shows players stats
          across 27 seasons of the NBA. I used Excel to first clean and
          standarize the data then imported the cleaned data into MySQL
          Workbench for analysis.
        </p>
        <h3>Data Cleaning</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Search for duplicates and none were found</li>
          <li>Change column names to be more in line with values</li>
          <li>Standarize data within college, country columns</li>
          <li>
            Fill in NULL values within college column with the college name the
            player went to, if player had no college I filled in cells with "No
            College"
          </li>
          <li>Converted player_weight column from Kilos to Pounds</li>
          <li>
            In draft_year,draft_round,draft_number columns I changed "Undrafted"
            values to 0 to indicate the player did not get drafted and casted
            those columns to INT.
          </li>
          <li>All statistics columns I converted to Integers/Double</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Exploratory Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          Inital EDA includes counting unique amount of players that played in
          the NBA over 22 seasons and showing ammount of colleges in the dataset
          alongside NBA teams. We found the number of players each college
          produced to go to the NBA and showed the percentages of players origin
          country's across the 22 seasons.
        </p>
        <strong><em>Key facts from the data:</em></strong
        ><br />
        <i
          >I found that across the NBA from 1996-2022 83.4% of players are from
          the USA. Given that the sport was created and played here in the US
          makes sense for that number to be high. The second most NBA players
          are from Canada and France covering 1.60% & 1.48% of the league
          respectively. Kentucky, Duke & North Carolina produced the most NBA
          players out of any college/University. From this time Kentucky
          produced 451 players, Duke 410 & North Carolina 355. There are 337
          colleges that players came from and only 36 current NBA teams. This
          shows the fierce competiveness of a college athlete trying to make it
          to the big leagues.
