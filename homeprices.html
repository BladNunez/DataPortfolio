        <h1>Project Overview</h1>
        <p>
          I was curious about the housing market in Washington so I came across
          a dataset that was from 2014. This dataset contains listings of homes
          in diffrent cities across the state of Washington from May-July. In
          this project I was able to find insights such as how the pricing of
          homes differed due to what it contained such as amount of rooms or if
          the home was renovated, would that make a home more expensive? All
          questions and visuals are below.

        <h1>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</h1>
        <p><b>1. What is the distribution of home prices in Washington?</b></p>
        <img
          src="images/homeImages/One.jpg"
          alt="one"
          width="500"
          height="500"
        />
        <figcaption>
          The first question I wanted to answer was to analyze the distrubution
          of home prices in the state of Washington. I began by using a boxplot
          here that shows the distrubution of home prices. The circle that is
          showed is an outlier and this signifies the cheapest priced home in
          Washington that is at $7800. The first line above this circle is the
          minimum line and this shows that the minimum home price in our data is
          around $80,000. The blue box you see is the interquartile range and
          starting from the bottom is the lower quartile and the middle is the
          median. The top of the box is the upperquartile while the line at the
          top is the max value. I find here that the median price of homes is a
          little more then $300,000 while the max is north of $440,000.
        </figcaption>
        <br /><br />

        <p>
          <b>2. How does the number of bedrooms correlate with home prices?</b>
        </p>
        <img
          src="images/homeImages/Two.jpg"
          alt="one"
          width="700"
          height="550"
        />
        <figcaption>
          In this visual I use a scatter plot to see if there is a correlation
          between the price of a home and the number of bedrooms it has. A
          scatter plot is used to plot two variables and see if one variable
          will make the other go up or vice versa. In this case the two
          variables are bedrooms and home price. I analyze here that if a home
          continues to have more bedrooms then the price of that home will
          increase. The trend line is continuing to go up as the amount of
          bedrooms increases proving the price of the home will also go up.
        </figcaption>
        <br /><br />

        <p>
          <b>3. What is the average square footage of living space in homes?</b>
        </p>
        <img
          src="images/homeImages/Three.jpg"
          alt="one"
          width="500"
          height="200"
        />
        <figcaption>
          The average square feet of homes in the state of Washington is
          2,139ft.
        </figcaption>
        <br /><br />
        <p>
          <b>
            4. Is there a correlation between the number of bathrooms and home
            prices?
          </b>
        </p>
        <img
          src="images/homeImages/Four.jpg"
          alt="one"
          width="700"
          height="550"
        />
        <figcaption>
          Again I use a scatter plot to show the correlation between amount of
          bathrooms and home price. As you see with the trend line going up we
          analyze that the more bathrooms a home has the price of the home will
          increase so these two variables have a strong correlation.
        </figcaption>
        <br /><br />
        <p>
          <b>
            5. How does the condition of homes vary across different cities in
            Washington?
          </b>
        </p>
        <img
          src="images/homeImages/Five.jpg"
          alt="one"
          width="800"
          height="500"
        />
        <figcaption>
          In this visual I use a bar chart that is used to compare numerical
          values of objects. Here I use the bar chart to compare each cities
          home condition to each other. I find that the city of Inglewood-Finn
          Hill has the highest average home condition of 5 which is the best
          home condition while the city of Snoqualmie Pass is at 3 which this
          being the lowest home condtion of all cities in Washington.
        </figcaption>
        <br /><br />
        <p>
          <b>6. Are renovated homes priced higher than non-renovated ones?</b>
        </p>
        <img
          src="images/homeImages/Six.jpg"
          alt="one"
          width="500"
          height="500"
        />
        <figcaption>
          I use another bar chart here to compare average price of non-renovated
          homes and renovated ones. I find that homes that have not been
          renovated are higher in price then to ones that are.
        </figcaption>
        <br /><br />
        <p>
          <b>
            7. Is there a difference in prices between waterfront and
            non-waterfront properties?
          </b>
        </p>
        <img
          src="images/homeImages/Eight.jpg"
          alt="one"
          width="500"
          height="500"
        />
        <figcaption>
          Another bar chart is utilized to show average price of homes that have
          a waterfront and those that do not. Here we visualize that homes that
          have a waterfront are double the average price of homes without one.
        </figcaption>
        <br /><br />
        <p><b>8. How has the average home price changed over the months?</b></p>
        <img
          src="images/homeImages/Nine.jpg"
          alt="one"
          width="700"
          height="500"
        />
        <figcaption>
          I wanted to analyze the difference in home price from the months
          available so this visual shows that May was the lowest average home
          price while June was the highest at $575,115
        </figcaption>
        <br /><br />
        <p><b>9. What cities have the highest average home prices?</b></p>
        <img
          src="images/homeImages/Ten.jpg"
          alt="one"
          width="600"
          height="500"
        />
        <figcaption>
          I visualize the top 5 most expensive cities in Washington. I found
          that Bellevue, Mercer Island, Yarrow Point, Clyde Hill and Medina are
          the most expensive cities with Medina being at the top with an average
          price of $2,000,000.

          I used Microsoft Excel for the cleaning and preparation of my dataset.
          Remove Duplicates and handle missing values. Change data types of
          numeric data into integers. Split data into new columns for
          readability and Remove extra wording from columns

        <h2>Feature Engineering</h2>
        <p>
          As I started to clean my dataset I had a date column that was in the
          format of "m/d/yyyy 00:00:00 AM". I removed the timestamp from the
          date column and then split the date into seperate month, day, year
          columns. I dealt with another column that contained zip code and state
          name together so I split those up into there own columns for
          readability.

      <section id="challenges">
        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <p>
          One challenge I faced during the cleaning process was with the
          'yr_renovated' column. Rows had the year that the home was renovated
          but also it contained zeroes and that indicated that the home was not
          renovated. For readability I wanted to change those zeroes to NULL to
          indicate to the users that the home was not renovated. I struggled to
          change those zeroes to the NULL value in excel during the cleaning
          process. I believe more studying into excel will help me find the
          answer. As for a solution during analysis with SQL and visualization
          with Tableau I filter out the the zeroes from the 'yr_renovated'
          column when I am working with it so it is not interpreted that the
          home was renovated at year 0 nor it impacts the analysis by distorting
          the results.
