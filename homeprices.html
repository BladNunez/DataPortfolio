        <h1>Project Overview</h1>
        <p>
          I was curious about the housing market in Washington so I came across
          a dataset that was from 2014. This dataset contains listings of homes
          in diffrent cities across the state of Washington. In this project I
          was able to find insights such as how the pricing of homes differed
          due to what it contained such as amount of rooms or if the home was
          renovated, would that make a home more expensive? All questions and
          visuals are below.

          I obtained this washington housing dataset from

          This Github contains 200+ datasets that can be used to practice and
          build skills in data analysis. Thank you to the author for putting it
          together.

        <p>
          I used Microsoft Excel for the cleaning and preparation of my dataset.
          Remove Duplicates and handle missing values. Change data types of
          numeric data into integers. Split data into new columns for
          readability and Remove extra wording from columns
        </p>

        <h2>Feature Engineering</h2>
        <p>
          As I started to clean my dataset I had a date column that was in the
          format of "m/d/yyyy 00:00:00 AM". I removed the timestamp from the
          date column and then split the date into seperate month, day, year
          columns. I dealt with another column that contained zip code and state
          name together so I split those up into there own columns for
          readability.

        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <p>
          One challenge I faced during the cleaning process was with the
          'yr_renovated' column. Rows had the year that the home was renovated
          but also it contained zeroes and that indicated that the home was not
          renovated. For readability I wanted to change those zeroes to NULL to
          indicate to the users that the home was not renovated. I struggled to
          change those zeroes to the NULL value in excel during the cleaning
          process. I believe more studying into excel will help me find the
          answer. As for a solution during analysis with SQL and visualization
          with Tableau I filter out the the zeroes from the 'yr_renovated'
          column when I am working with it so it is not interpreted that the
          home was renovated at year 0 nor it impacts the analysis by distorting
          the results.
