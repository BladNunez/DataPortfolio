        <h1>Project Overview</h1>
        <p>
          This project consists of La Liga player statistics for the 2022-2023
          season. With this dataset I am able to gain insights on player
          performance during the 2022-2023 La Liga season such as who scored the
          most goals and obtained the most assists. In this project I was able
          to compare and analyze player performance across the league.

        <h2>Findings/Insights</h2>
        <p>
          Some insights I gained from this dataset is that even if players play
          the max amount of minutes every game that does not dictate weather
          they will have a lot of goals, assists or even man of the match
          awards. None of the players that had the most goals or man of the
          match awards played the most minutes. Another insight I gained was
          that even if a player such as Karim Benzema having the highest amount
          of shots on goal that does not guarantee that player will obtain the
          most goals. To win the man of the match award scoring goals and
          accumalating many assists help your chances to win the award
          tremoundously. For example Robert Lewandowski finished the season with
          15 goals and he received 7 man of the match awards as well as the La
          Liga season leader in assists Antoine Griezmann having 8 assists. The
          more of these two factors players have the more man of the match
          awards they can receive.
