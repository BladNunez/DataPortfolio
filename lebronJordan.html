        <h1>Project Overview</h1>
        <p>
          Since Micheal Jordan's career ended everyone said he is the best
          player of all time. Till Lebron James stepped in the NBA, now there
          has been two sides of debate to who is the "Goat" of basketball. These
          two players are the best in their craft and I wanted to analyze their
          career statistics for the regular season as well as playoffs. In this
          analysis I dove into their points per game, assists, rebounds, blocks
          as well as their win percentages throughout their career. Of course
          Micheal Jordan retired around the time Lebron came into the NBA and
          Lebron is still currently playing. This data goes up to October 2020
          for Lebron James so even though up to this point I dont have data for
          the past four years, I am just analyzing Micheal Jordan from the start
          to the end of his career which is 1984-2003 and Lebron James from the
          start of his career which was 2003 up to October 2020. Questions I
          will be answering in this analysis are:
          <br /><br />
          1. How do their regular season per game and total stats compare? What
          about their playoff stats?
          <br />
          2. At what age did each player have their highest scoring season?
          <br />
          3. How have their win percentages trended by season? Who has a better
          win percentage in the playoffs?

        <figcaption>
          I use a side by side bar chart to be able to compare the diffrent
          values in the dataset such as points, assists, total rebounds, blocks
          and steals for both players careers in the regular season and
          playoffs. Starting from the left in the graph I put Lebrons and
          Jordans playoff stats together for comparision. We can see that Jordan
          averages 33.5 points in playoffs compared to Lebrons 28. So far up to
          2020 Lebron outperforms Jordan in the playoffs with total rebounds and
          assists. Jordan achieves more steals in the playoffs compared to
          Lebron but Lebron achieves more blocks. The same goes for the regular
          season Jordan scores more points then Lebron while Lebron achieves
          more rebounds and assists.

        <img src="images/jordan/two.jpg" alt="one" width="750" height="550" />
        <figcaption>
          I use a table here to visualize at what age did each player achieve
          their highest points in a regular season. In both of their third
          seasons in the NBA Micheal Jordan scored the most in his regular
          season career at the age of 23 while Lebron scored his highest points
          in a season at the age of 21.

        <h3>Jordans Win Percentage Over Seasons Played:</h3>
        <img src="images/jordan/3a.jpg" alt="one" width="750" height="600" />
        <figcaption>
          A line chart is used here to see the progression of Micheal Jordans
          win percentage each season he has played. I highlight the minimum win
          percentage which was his first year and the highest winning season he
          had was 87.8% during his 11th season. After his 5th season Micheal
          Jordan stayed above a 60% win rate each season until the last 2
          seasons of his career where he ended at around 50% win rate.
        </figcaption>
        <br />
        <h3>Lebrons Win Percentage Over Seasons Played:</h3>
        <img src="images/jordan/3b.jpg" alt="one" width="750" height="600" />
        <figcaption>
          Again a line chart is used to know analyze Lebron James win percentage
          from the time he began in the NBA until 2020. I highlight his minimum
          win rate which was at the start of his career at 41.5% and the maximum
          win rate he has gained in this data which is 81% in his 6th season.
          Starting from his 3rd season Lebron has stayed above 60% win rate
          until his 15th and 16th season where it dropped to around 55%. In his
          17th season in 2020 his win rate increased up to 74%.
        </figcaption>
        <br />
        <h3>Win Percentage In Playoffs:</h3>
        <img src="images/jordan/3c.jpg" alt="one" width="550" height="500" />
        <figcaption>
          In the playoffs for both players careers Micheal Jordan ups Lebron
          with 66.7% win rate in the playoffs compared to Lebrons 66.3%. Seeing
          this of course the margin is very low so this shows that both players
          are positive in wins during the playoffs.

        <h2>Insights</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Micheal Jordan is more productive on offense then Lebron in terms of
            points as well as steals on defense.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Lebron outperforms Jordan in rebounds and assists in both regular
            season play and playoffs.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Up until 2020 Jordan has a higher career playoff win rate compared
            to Lebron at 66.7%.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Due to Lebron playing longer then Jordan he has more seasons above
            60% win rate throughout his career.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Jordan at age 23 in his third season scored 1,817 points which
            marked his highest regular season in points.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Lebron at age 21 in his third season scored 1,641 points which
            marked his highest regular season in points.

          I used the Lebron vs Jordan data set from Maven Analytics which can be

            Modify values in result column that contained 'W' and 'L' for wins

        <h2>Feature Engineering</h2>
        <p>
          My data had the dates for the games played but there was no data about
          which season it was played in for each player. I used the date column
          to then be able to create a new column called season that contained
          the season in which a particular game was played. Doing this helped
          with analysis and be able to distinct stats in each season for both
          players.

      <section id="challenges">
        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <p>
          To make my visualizations more neat and using less space I wanted to
          use dual lines in a line chart that showed the win percentage
          progression of both Jordan and Lebron in one. From my SQL analysis I
          used 2 queries for each players trend. I did not end up solving how to
          connect both CSV files to then show the players data on one chart. To
          solve this I will research more about Tableau to be able to create
          this visual in future projects.
