        <h1>Project Overview</h1>
        <p>
          In this project I am analyzing a year's worth of sales from a
          fictitious pizza shop in 2015 that contains the date and time of each
          order and the pizzas served, with additional details on the type,
          size, quantity, price, and ingredients. Questions I will be answering
          in this analysis are down below.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            How many customers do we have each day? Are there any peak hours?
          </li>
          <li>
            How many pizzas are typically in an order? Do we have any
            bestsellers?
          </li>
          <li>
            How much money did we make this year? Can we indentify any
            seasonality in the sales?
          </li>
          <li>
            Are there any pizzas we should take of the menu, or any promotions
            we could leverage?
          </li>
        </ol>

        <figcaption>
          In this table I have uploaded the CSV from my analysis and are able to
          scroll to see how many customers our pizza shop has had everyday with
          a majority of days having >50 customers.

        <figcaption>
          I use a bar graph here to show our peak hours based on amount of
          customers we had throughout the year We can see that at noon and 1Pm
          we have our most business come in. The next greatest rush of traffic
          would be at 5 and 6Pm. Before lunch time we have less then 10 people
          come in at around 9-10Am.
        </figcaption>

        <p>
          <b>2. How many pizzas are typically in an order?</b>
        </p>
        <img src="images/pizza/2.png" alt="one" width="600" height="300" />
        <figcaption>
          On average we typically have one pizza in each order this year.

          <b
            >3. How much money did we make this year? Can we indentify any

        <img src="images/pizza/3A.png" alt="one" width="600" height="300" />
        <figcaption>
          For the year of 2015 the pizza shop made $817,860 dollars.
        </figcaption>
        <br /><br />
        <img src="images/pizza/3B.png" alt="one" width="700" height="400" />
        <figcaption>
          In July the shop made its most money for the month with $72,558 in
          revenue. From August, September and October we see a decline in
          monthly sales and by November we increase in revenue sales. Months of
          January, July, March, May and November we see these are our popular
          months for best sales.
        </figcaption>
        <br /><br />

          <b>
            4. Are there any pizzas we should take off the menu, or any
            promotions we could leverage? Do we have any bestsellers?
          </b>
        </p>
        <table id="csv-table2">
          <thead align="left">
            <tr></tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody></tbody>
        </table>
        <figcaption>
          Based off our scrollable table here we look at all our pizzas we offer
          and the amount of revenue each brought in for the year. We see that
          our top three bestsellers are the Thai chicken pizza, BBQ chicken
          pizza and the California chicken pizza. Based off analysis I would not
          take any pizzas off the menu even though the Brie Carre Pizza is our
          least popular and only brought in $11,000 dollars in revenue. If we
          take it off the menu that is $11,000 dollars off our yearly revenue.
          From the line chart above we see that we have a decline in sales from
          August, September and October. I would utilize that time period to
          have deals with our best selling pizzas such as a buy one get one
          free. I believe this would give us more sales throughout those months
          to increase revenue. Based on our best times we sell I would want the
          shop to promote these deals from 12-2Pm and 4-6Pm.
