        <h2>Recommendations</h2>
        <p>
          Based on analysis the actions I recommend for people looking to move
          to Los Angeles is to work full time and take advantage of benefit pay
          that jobs in the city can offer to you. If you are a pilot in the city
          then your career can be very lucrative for compensation. Los Angeles
          is a city where you can have a great career as the years have passed
          more money has been payed out to employees but with a little dip in
          2023 I expect that amount to go up in 2024.

        <h2>Limitations</h2>
        <p>
          I used MySQL workbench for my SQL analysis of this LA pay roll
          dataset. One limitation I faced was due to my CSV file containing
          500,000 rows of data, MYSQL workbench was not able to import all
          500,000 rows. I had to create a schema from scratch with new tables
          and a temporary table that contained the whole CSV file. This was done
          in the MySQL command line interface. I imported the CSV into my temp
          table with the load local infile command and then created my new
          tables from this temp table with the necassary columns needed for each
          table. From here I was able to conduct my SQL analysis in MySQL
          workbench with all rows of data imported into my schema. Some other
          limitations I faced was that for the ethnicity column there were a few
          hundred not listed so was not able to get the full amount of disparity
          between ethnicitys in Los Angeles.
