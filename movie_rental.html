        <h1>Project Overview</h1>
        <p>
          To enhance my SQL skills I decided to create this project where I
          analyze movie rental data from customers across diffrent countries and
          find information in my dataset such as customer behaviors, movie
          trends, revenue, and performance metrics. To populate my database I
          used a site called Mockaroo that generates hypothetical data for your
          database using artifical intelligence.

        <p>
          I created my database using MySQL workbench that runs locally. My data
          that I generated using Mockaroo was clean already. My schema consists
          of 5 tables and you can see an image of my UML diagram below. You can
          also observe that I have arrows attaching my primary keys in my parent
          tables to foreign keys in my child tables.
