      <section id="introduction">
        <h1>Project Overview</h1>
        <p>
          Many Consider Caitlyn Clark who is currently a guard for the Iowa
          Hawkeyes womens basketball team to be the greatest player ever in
          womens college basketball thus far. But with every great thing theres
          always the bad. With her fans there are also critics who think because
          Caitlyn Clark currently leads D1 womens basketball in scoring that she
          is considered a "ball-hog" which indicates she never passes the ball
          to her teammates. This project will compare Caitlyn Clark and other
          women basketball players in division 1 in scoring and assists so far
          this year. As I compare the scoring to assists ratio I will want to
          prove that she is not a "ball-hog" and indeed passes the ball to her
          teammates and still is efficient herself with her scoring
          capabilities.
          <br /><br />
          Problem: Prove that Caitlyn Clark is not indeed a "ball-hog" but an
          efficient scorer and passer
          <br /><br />

        <h1>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</h1>
        <p><b>1.) First Proof</b></p>
        <img src="images/clark/one.jpg" alt="one" width="500" height="500" />
        <figcaption>
          I use a table to display 15 womens college basketball players and sort
          it by "APG" which stands for "Assists per game". As we can see Caitlyn
          Clark leads D1 womens basketball in assists with 9 APG. Of course we
          can also see that she has the most "PPG" which stands for "Points per
          game" at 32 PPG. The values highlighted in blue mean that those
          players are not in the top 10 in PPG in D1. All the other 10 players
          are in the top 10 and we see that the players who are not in top 10
          scoring list have more assists then 8 other players in the top 10
          scoring list. This shows that Caitlyn Clark clearly leads players who
          are in the top 10 of both scoring and assists per game.
        </figcaption>
        <br /><br />
        <p><b>2.) Second Proof</b></p>
        <img src="images/clark/two.jpg" alt="one" width="750" height="500" />
        <figcaption>
          Now I want to visualize the PPG and APG within our data. Here I use a
          scatter plot to compare these 2 variables. We can see that Caitlyn
          Clark is all the way in the right corner of the graph. This indicates
          that she has the highest points per game as well as the highest
          assists per game. The next player closests to Clark in assists is
          McKenna Hofschild with 7.3 APG but she is low in points compared to
          Clark at 22 PPG. For points the next player closest to Clark is Juju
          Watkins from Southern California with 27 PPG but very low in assist
          compared to Clark at 3.3 APG. The names under McKenna Hofschild are
          the 5 players who are not in the top 10 in scoring but are in assists.
          This proves that Caitlyn Clark is an efficent scorer and passer and
          very remarkable that she leads in both categories by a significant
          margin.

        <h2>Data Sources</h2>
        <p>
          I used webscraping to scrape the top 10 points per game scorers in
          womens college basketball as well as all 250 players in the 'Assists
          per game' category

        <h2>Data Cleaning/Preprocessing</h2>
        <p>
          The data cleaning process was simple. I did not have to do any
          excessive cleaning of the data due to it being clean ready already. I
          only stripped the text needed from each row of data needed for
          analysis.

        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <p>
          This was a learning process on webscraping data from websites for the
          first time. I had some trouble plotting two variables due to
          type-error issues. I later found that when plotting two numerical
          variables that I need to convert them from a string to numbers using
          the "to_numeric()" function. For the future now I know this needs to
          be done before plotting to avoid this error.
